## How to set this up locally

1. Before running this website locally, first we need to set up the feature flag properly on the LaunchDarkly platform.
2. One of the features I have set up is to add in a few field in the appointment request form to gather data around respiratory symptoms to provide the best care and protect other patients.
3. We need to create a feature flag named **'newDataField'** on the platform, and copy the SDK key
4. In _index.js_, look for _const client = LaunchDarkly.init(LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY);_, replace LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY with the SDK key you copied in Step 4.
5. WooHoo, you are ready to move on and run the application locally.
